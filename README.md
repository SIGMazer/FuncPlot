# Python GUI for Function Solver and Plotter

This is a Python GUI application that takes two mathematical functions from the user, solves them, plots them, and annotates the solution point. The application supports basic operators like +, -, *, /, ^, log10(), and sqrt(). It uses Pyside2 for the GUI and Matplotlib for plotting.
